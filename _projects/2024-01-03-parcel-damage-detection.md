## Project Overview

The Parcel Detection System uses advanced computer vision technology to automatically detect parcels and assess their condition in logistics and delivery environments. This comprehensive system identifies parcels and classifies them as either good or damaged, enhancing operational efficiency and quality control.

## Key Features

### Detection Capabilities
- **Parcel Identification**: Accurate detection of parcels in various environments
- **Damage Assessment**: Classification of parcels as good or damaged
- **Quality Control**: Automated evaluation of parcel condition and integrity
- **Real-time Processing**: Instant detection and damage assessment results

### System Capabilities
- High-speed processing with real-time results
- Multi-angle parcel detection
- Automated quality reports
- Integration with existing logistics systems
- Mobile deployment for field operations

## Technical Implementation

The system utilizes YOLOv8 object detection model optimized for parcel detection scenarios. The model was trained on a comprehensive dataset of parcel images covering various sizes, shapes, and environmental conditions.

## Impact on Logistics

- 70% improvement in parcel processing speed
- Enhanced accuracy in parcel identification
- Automated quality control processes
- Reduced manual inspection requirements
